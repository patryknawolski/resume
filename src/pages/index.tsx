          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Experienced software developer with focus on front end, based in
            Warsaw. I love clean code and pay attention to modularity and
            maintainability of my solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd never copy and paste existing code without abstracting it
            somehow to make the code reusable.{" "}
            <strong className={`${styles.textUnderscored} ${styles.textLight}`}>
              I'm a developer - not a coder
            </strong>
            . I will not only produce code to implement features described by a
            PM, but also give my own advises in terms of UX of the application
            or even business solutions if I get any ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong className={`${styles.textUnderscored} ${styles.textLight}`}>
              Let's make your app great together!

          <ul>
            <li>Creation of new single page applications</li>
            <li>Maintenance of existing projects</li>

          </ul>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            The first project that I was engaged in Idego was a greenfield one
            (I had to build it from scratch). It was a platform that offers
            tools for browsing and viewing reports, analyzes and last but not
            least - ratings of companies prepared by analysts hired by that
            platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most challenging thing at the beginning was choosing the designs
            - because we haven't had designers onboard and needed as good UX as
            possible I aimed for some proven UI library. After many researches
            and comparisons we were convinced to use material-ui.
          </p>
          <h3>Stack</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>Storybook</li>
            <li>Redux</li>
            <li>redux-saga</li>
            <li>react-router</li>
            <li>formik </li>
            <li>lodash</li>
            <li>material-ui</li>
            <li>styled-components</li>
            <li>Java/Python on back end</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The second project that I had a pleasure to work in was already
            existing, working platform that allows users to manage, agregate and
            compare social media records (for now Facebook and Instagram posts).
          </p>
          <p>
            The funny part is that it was Vue project and... I have never been
            using Vue before. It's even funnier that it was not so challenging
            at all. Vue nowadays is so similar in concepts to React that you can
            easily jump from one to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            My tasks there were connected with adding new features, refactoring
            existing spaghetticode and proposing UX upgrades to the client.
